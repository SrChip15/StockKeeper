Inventory App Project
======================

The application helps a small business owner to log and track inventory. Essentially, the application is managed in two screens.
The splash screen or in this case, the catalog screen, lists all the owner's inventory along with related product details. The 
owner can also make quick sale from this screen by clicking on the "sell" button on the right hand side of the screen.

Secondly, the editor screen, lets the owner to add a product to the inventory. All details requested in this screen is 
mandatory to successfully add the product to the database. Failing to do so does not log the product and consequently cannot be 
tracked with this application. The owner can also order more of the same existing product by going into the editor screen, this 
time, and clicking on the "order more" button. For existing products, along with the product information additional options and
"order more" feature is also displayed. By clicking on the "order more" button the owner is handed over a new email template 
with "from", "to" and "subject" pre-filled, using the default email application.

This app has been built to the specifications of the inventory app project rubric, which is part of the 
Data Storage module of [Udacity's Android Basics Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803).
